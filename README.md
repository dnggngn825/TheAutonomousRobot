Software for running the robot that is the focus of the Autonomous Systems Clinic [ELEN90090] subject.

# Objective
To design an autonomous robot, which works in a small-scale warehouse. The robotâ€™s fundamental functionality is to deliver a range of objects from a predefined collection area to an unloading area.
# Brief description
This project focuses on control and software design, based on the given robot platform. The robotic prototype will then be applied to work in a warehouse of no obstacles. However, there are two NOACCESS zones in the layout of warehouse. This robot contacts with the collection areas and receptacle areas via the markers, which helps to determine the object categories. Once the robot approaches these areas and a requested signal was sent, the items are manually dispensed.
