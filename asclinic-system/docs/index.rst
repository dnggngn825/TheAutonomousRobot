Asclinic Wiki
=============

Welcome to the software and hardware wiki for the Autonomous Systems Clinic (`ELEN90090 <https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/elen90090>`_).

This wiki is intended as the location for all documentation related to the software and hardware for the robot used in ASClinic.

This wiki is expected to grow and expand as semester progresses, and everyone is encouraged to make contributions and point out errors. Email Paul (`<paul.beuchat@unimelb.edu.au>`_) with any suggestions.
